# Fender Digital Platform Engineering Challenge

## Description

Design and implement a RESTful web service to facilitate a user authentication system. The authentication mechanism should be *token based*. Requests and responses should be in **JSON**.

## Requirements

**Models**

The **User** model should have the following properties (at minimum):

1. name
2. email
3. password

You should determine what, *if any*, additional models you will need.

**Endpoints**

All of these endpoints should be written from a user's perspective.

1. **User** Registration
2. Login (*token based*) - should return a token, given *valid* credentials
3. Logout - logs a user out
4. Update a **User**'s Information
5. Delete a **User**

**README**

Please include:
- A readme file that explains your thinking
- How to set up and run the project
- If you choose to use a database, include instructions on how to set that up
- If you have tests, include instructions on how to run them
- A description of what enhancements you might make if you had more time.
